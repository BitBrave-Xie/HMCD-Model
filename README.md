# HMCD-Model

Because the file size is too large (47G), and VPN and campus network are charged, we upload partial data(1,000 malicious samples, 5,000 benign samples in a subdataset).

In addition, we use hashing for data masking in data set to protect privacy.

An HTTP session sample consists of multiple request and response packets. Generally, a request and response correspond to each other, and the request packets are separated by "____". Each line is an HTTP field line. A number represents a character.

The data composition in the demo dataset is: HMCT-2020(18) has 1,000 malicious samples and 5,000 benign samples. HMCT-2020(19-20) has 1,000 malicious samples and 5,000 benign samples. Real traffic has 1,000 malicious samplesï¼Œthe list of real malwares, and 5,000 benign samples.
